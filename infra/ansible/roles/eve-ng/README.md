Role for install eve-ng
============================================================
Requirements:
- Ubuntu 20.04(focal)
- 50 Gb Disk space 


Required CPU and RAM depend on how many nodes are needed to run. 4 vCPU and 6GB of RAM can be enough for IOU/IOL and Dynamips only, but will be insufficient for topology with CSR1000V routers.
